# Yatrack üöç
Yatrack is a real-time location tracking system designed to improve school bus management and safety. This app enables drivers to update their bus's real-time location, sends notifications to parents or students as the bus approaches pick-up/drop-off points, and provides administrators with tools to manage fleet and routes.

## Features ‚ú®

## Background 

This was a small idea for a startup that I worked with along with my co-founder. In the process to try to bring forth this idea to fruition, we managed to build a complete product with a working database, backend and frontend but sadly enough, we couldn't work out the startup.
